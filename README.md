# RealTime-SolarSystem


This project was created in around 3 weeks. The goal was to create a real-time simulation of our Solar System in a realistic scale. The positions of the 8 planets and the Moon on their orbits are accurate and update accordingly to the time of the year. Also the rotation of the Earth is correct and shows which side of itself faces the Sun (including the North and South poles).

The position on the orbit was computed using Keplerian elements of each planet and the current date. We followed this tutorial : http://www.stjarnhimlen.se/comp/tutorial.html
